This Minecraft Mod adds a new type of equipment, the [Ragnarok Cards](https://github.com/GustavoSasaki/Ragnarok-Cards/wiki/Ragnarok-Card), which gives to the player a variety of positive and negative effects.


Every player can equip 9 of them each time, which expands the number of possible builds, and makes viable multiple specialization, such as in ranged weapons or applying negative effects on the enemy or even being really good at killing pigs.  


Examples: 
- Piglin: the player deals +1.5 damage with weapons made of bad materials, but attacks from undead are 20% stronger and causes hunger
- Wolf: Pets deal +1 damage and have 20% chance to nullify damage, but the player receive 10% more damage from anything
- Zombie Piglin: the player have 4% chance to deal 3x damage, but have 2% chance to receive 3x damage
[Here](https://github.com/GustavoSasaki/Ragnarok-Cards/wiki/Ragnarok-Card#effects) is the table of effects

*To equip a Ragnarok Card just put It inside a [Ragnarok Bag](https://github.com/GustavoSasaki/Ragnarok-Cards/wiki/Ragnarok-Bag) in your inventory. (Click in the link for more detail)

Also, since every vanilla mob (at least in the future updates) have a really rare chance to drop its unique Ragnarok Card, this mod gives to the players a new goals, collect all the Ragnarok Cards and makes more rewarding exploring and killing mobs (especially useless ones, such as bats).
